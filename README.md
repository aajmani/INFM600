Conclusion
-----------

Question: Which cities need more day care centers?

For answering this question, number of day care centers, population by city and number of working parents with children can be merged to understand the need for more day care centers. In order to derive at number of working parents with children in a particular city, data from IRS dataset is considered. Number of child tax credit returns from the IRS dataset relates to number of working parents with children.  

By plotting a graph with population of working parents, population of city and the corresponding number of day care centers in the city, we can understand the demand for day care centers. The county can use this data to analyse which cities need more day care centers.

Approximate conclusions can also be derived on which cities have families with more kids.
